1. Setup & Ease of Use
Shopify: Quick setup with minimal technical knowledge.

Custom E-commerce: Requires development effort but provides full control over design and features.

2. Features & Flexibility
Shopify: Built-in tools, but advanced features often require paid apps.

Custom E-commerce: Fully tailored features like AI-driven recommendations, multi-vendor support, and personalized checkout.

3. Costs & Long-Term Investment
Shopify: Monthly fees and transaction commissions make it an ongoing expense.

Custom Website: Higher initial investment but eliminates platform restrictions and recurring costs.

### Who Should Choose What?

Shopify: Best for small businesses, dropshipping stores, and those needing a quick-to-launch solution.

Custom E-commerce: Ideal for businesses with complex needs, high-volume sales, and brand-specific customization.
