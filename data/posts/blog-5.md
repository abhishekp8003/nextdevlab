1. Instant Access Without Installation
PWAs run directly from a web browser, eliminating the need for app store downloads.

Reduces friction for users who avoid installing apps, leading to higher engagement.

Provides a native app-like experience with smooth interactions and quick loading.

2. Offline Functionality
Cached data allows users to browse content and access key features even without an internet connection.

Ensures uninterrupted user experience, making it ideal for e-commerce, news platforms, and service-based businesses.

Improves accessibility, especially in regions with limited or unstable internet connectivity.

3. Cost-Effective & Scalable
A single PWA codebase works across all devices—desktop, mobile, and tablets—reducing development costs.

Businesses avoid the complexities of maintaining separate Android and iOS apps while reaching a broader audience.

PWAs offer better performance, security, and user retention compared to traditional mobile websites.
